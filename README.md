### Backend Integration Points

#### RESTful API Endpoints
The frontend expects the following API endpoints:

```
/api/v1/auth                # Authentication endpoints
/api/v1/water-samples       # Water sample data endpoints
/api/v1/analytics           # Analysis and metrics endpoints
/api/v1/alerts              # Alert management endpoints
/api/v1/reports             # Report generation endpoints
/api/v1/treatments          # Treatment simulation endpoints

/api/v1/settings            # User and system settings
```

#### WebSocket Integration
Real-time data is consumed through WebSocket connections:

```javascript
// Example WebSocket implementation
const socket = new WebSocket('wss://api.hydra-water.com/ws');

socket.onmessage = (event) => {
  const data = JSON.parse(event.data);
  
  switch (data.type) {
    case 'alert':
      // Handle new water quality alert
      // Potentially trigger emergency mode
      break;
    case 'sample':
      // Handle new water sample data
      break;
    case 'metrics':
      // Handle updated metrics
      break;
    default:
      console.log('Unknown message type', data);
  }
};
```

#### Authentication Flow
The application uses OAuth 2.0 with JWT for authentication:

1. User login through `/api/v1/auth/login`
2. JWT token received and stored in secure HTTP-only cookie
3. Token refresh through `/api/v1/auth/refresh`
