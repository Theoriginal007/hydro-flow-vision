- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Shadcn UI component library
- React Router for navigation
- TanStack Query for data fetching
- Zod for form validation
- Recharts for data visualization

## Water Treatment Form Features

The treatment recommendation form collects comprehensive data about:

- Client information: Name and contact details
- Water source: Source type (Borehole, River, Tap, Well, Other), daily requirements, flow rates, and hours of operation
- Lab results: Upload capability and manual parameter entry (pH, TDS, conductivity, hardness, iron)
- Location details: Installation address and region selection
- Budget constraints: Maximum budget with slider interface and urgency level selection
- Industry specifications: Type of industry (Beverages, Pharmaceuticals, Bottling, Agriculture, Industrial)

Based on this data, the AI generates:
- Customized treatment recommendations based on water quality parameters
- Provisional quotes with component-by-component breakdown
- Estimated delivery timelines based on urgency level
- Final quotations after comprehensive review

## Smart Recommendation Engine

The system analyzes multiple data points to provide intelligent recommendations:
- Water source type determines filtration requirements
- pH level triggers appropriate correction systems
- TDS levels influence membrane filtration recommendations
- Iron content suggests specialized removal systems
- Industry type customizes solutions for specific requirements

## Quote Generation System

The quotation system provides:
- Component-level pricing breakdown
- Installation and service estimates
- Timeline projections based on urgency
- Dynamic recalculation based on selected components
- Final quote generation with detailed specifications
